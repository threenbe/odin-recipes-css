# Basic Recipe Website

This is a basic recipe website that I built in my quest to learn more about web development while following The Odin Project.

This project is a continuation of [this project](https://github.com/threenbe/odin-recipes), and will serve as a demonstration of my CSS skills thus far.

Since this project has me yoinking recipes off the internet to display here, the authors will be credited accordingly on each page. Maybe some day I'll add one of my own recipes, or my mother's, but that's the besides the point of this project for now.
