        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>These baked chicken drumsticks are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, made with a sweet and tangy BBQ sauce. Makes around 6 servings.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>4 lbs chicken drumsticks (around 12 drumsticks)</li>
          <li>2 tbsp garlic powder</li>
          <li>2 tbsp onion powder</li>
          <li>2 tbsp chili powder or cayenne powder</li>
          <li>1 tbsp ground ginger</li>
          <li>2 tsp salt</li>
          <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
          <li>2 cups BBQ sauce</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ul class="prep-time">
          <li><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 10 minutes</li>
          <li><strong>Marination Time:</strong> 30 minutes to overnight</li>
          <li><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 50 minutes</li>
          <li><strong>Total Time:</strong> 60 minutes (+ marination)</li>
          <li><strong>Servings:</strong> 6</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
          <li>In a bowl, add drumsticks and all the spices. Using your clean or gloved hands, rub the seasoning all over the drumsticks.</li>
          <li>Let the drumsticks sit in the fridge for 30 minutes to overnight (optional).</li>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
          <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack on top.</li>
          <li>Transfer the drumsticks onto the wire rack, spacing them apart as much as possible.</li>
          <li>Bake in the middle of the oven for 40 minutes, flipping halfway through if desired.</li>
          <li>Remove from the oven and brush each drumstick with BBQ sauce. Return to the oven and bake for 10 minutes or broil on high until crisp, flipping halfway through.</li>
          <li>Remove and serve immediately, with some BBQ sauce on the side if desired.</li>
        </ol>
