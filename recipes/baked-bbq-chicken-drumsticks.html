    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These baked chicken drumsticks are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, made with a sweet and tangy BBQ sauce. Makes around 6 servings.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 lbs chicken drumsticks (around 12 drumsticks)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 tbsp onion powder</li>
      <li>2 tbsp chili powder or cayenne powder</li>
      <li>1 tbsp ground ginger</li>
      <li>2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
      <li>2 cups BBQ sauce</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a bowl, add drumsticks and all the spices. Using your clean or gloved hands, rub the seasoning all over the drumsticks.</li>
      <li>Let the drumsticks sit in the fridge for 30 minutes to overnight (optional).</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
      <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack on top.</li>
      <li>Transfer the drumsticks onto the wire rack, spacing them apart as much as possible.</li>
      <li>Bake in the middle of the oven for 40 minutes, flipping halfway through if desired.</li>
      <li>Remove from the oven and brush each drumstick with BBQ sauce. Return to the oven and bake for 10 minutes or broil on high until crisp, flipping halfway through.</li>
      <li>Remove and serve immediately, with some BBQ sauce on the side if desired.</li>
    </ol>
