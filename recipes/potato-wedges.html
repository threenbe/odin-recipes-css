    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These are easy, crispy oven-baked potato wedges with a savory-seasoned exterior and a soft fluffy interior, served with a simple and tasty sauce. Makes around 6 servings.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>For the potatoes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 lb red potatoes (about 6-8 red potatoes)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
      <li>1 tps salt</li>
      <li>1 tsp smoked paprika (may sub in regular paprika)</li>
      <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
      <li>Pinch of black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the dipping sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/3 cup mayo</li>
      <li>1/3 cup bbq sauce</li>
    </ul>



    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
      <li>Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchement paper.</li>
      <li>Cut the potatoes into 8 wedges. They should be less than 1/2 inch thick on the wide edge; if any are thicker, cut them in half again. Wipe the wedges dry with a paper towel to absorb excess starch.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine the potato wedges with the oil and toss to coat.</li>
      <li>Transfer wedges to the baking sheet, ensuring that they don't overlap. Try to have them not touch if possible.</li>
      <li>Bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Remove and flip with a fork or tongs, then bake for another 15 minutes. While the potatoes are baking, mix the mayo and bbq sauce in a bowl. The potatoes should appear brown and crispy on the edges and be fork-tender.</li>
    </ol>
